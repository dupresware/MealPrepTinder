This is the foundation for MealPrepTinder (Work in progress)

Our mission is to make the work of meal prepping easier, by enabling people to swipe through meals they like and don't like
so that the weekly process of selecting meal prep recipes is easy, fun, and has good variety.

Three things that set us apart:
  set your calorie goal for the week, or use our suggested amount for your weight gain  / loss goals
  scientifically proven protein requirement so that you hit the right average protein consumption per day / week
  nutritional breakdown for at least the 3 big nutrition macros
